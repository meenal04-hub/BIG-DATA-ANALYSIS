1. Introduction

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Netflix movies and TV shows to extract valuable insights and trends. By leveraging data cleaning and visualization techniques, we aim to explore content distribution, audience preferences, and patterns in Netflix's catalog. Additionally, the project serves as a foundation for building a recommendation system.
